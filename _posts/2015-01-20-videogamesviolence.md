title: "Do video games make people violent?"

In recent years controversy about computer games has hit the news again, particularly regarding Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Breivik, who had spent a year of his life playing World of Warcraft. Newspapers have wondered if the ["secret to the Norwegian massacre"](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dr-raj-persaud/norwegian-massacre-computer-games_b_1430831.html) lies in his obsession with games, and some retailers even [pulled games from the shelves](http://www.arbitragemagazine.com/general/norway-retailers-pull-violent2-video-games3-shelves4-massacre/) following the events. One commentator went so far as to suggest that the fact Breivik enjoyed role-playing games showed that he [could not distinguish fantasy from reality](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/norway/9211988/Anders-Breivik-unable-to-distinguish-reality-says-professor.html). The actions of this murderer were uncontroversially despicable, and all the more shocking because they were unexpected, and it is natural to want to find reasons for his behaviour. But does it make sense to point the finger at video games?

I am reminded of the documentary Bowling for Columbine, which explored the Columbine High School massacre and the local and national reactions to the terrible school shooting. A number of people and groups suggested that as the teenage perpetrators had listened to Marilyn Mason's music, it may have that which pushed them into violence. But as Michael Moore pointed out, the teenagers had also gone bowling before taking part in the crime. No one blamed bowling for the tragedy, so why blame music?
