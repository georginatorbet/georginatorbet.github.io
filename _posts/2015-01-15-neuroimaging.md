The use of neuroimaging outside of the medical and scientific domains is a frequent topic of interest for both the media and the public. Can brain scans detect early signs of criminality, detect lies, or be used to for more effective advertising and marketing? How do the opinions of the public differ from those of experts? The questionnaire study by Wardlaw et al. has compared the attitudes of the British public and neuroscience researchers on the limitations of neuroimaging and its ethical consequences.

The survey found that 60% of public respondents had seen information about brain imaging in the last 6 months, 
indicating a high level of penetration into the public consciousness. Despite frequent poor reporting of neuroimaging studies in the media, a large proportion of the public remained skeptical about the use of brain scans, particularly in legal, employment, or marketing contexts. Common concerns were data protection and privacy issues, as well as being compelled to undergo a brain scan for a job interview or health insurance.

Experts were, on the whole, more optimistic about the future potential for brain scan technology. There were concerns about the misuse of neuroimaging, such as in legal contexts, but they drastically underestimated the number of times in which magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) data had been used in court proceedings. There was a widespread belief that it was important to educate the public about the use of technology and the research findings of neuroimaging, but a general unwillingness to engage with the media. Generally, experts preferred to disseminate their findings through peer-reviewed journals.

Given the public interest in neuroimaging and a desire for high-quality scientific information, the lack of media engagement by experts may be problematic. When questioned about the reasons for poor-quality science reporting, experts revealed a concern over being misrepresented by journalists as an important factor in their unwillingness to engage with the press. However, there was also a belief that researchers tended to exaggerate their own results when dealing with journalists. Some concrete measures were suggested to overcome these problems, such as media engagement training, professional credit for public engagement, and requirement of engagement in order to secure funding. This survey shows a heartening public engagement with neuroimaging research, but also highlights the ways in which experts must communicate more effectively.
