When you want to learn a new language, there's no better way than to immerse yourself in that language's culture. If you have to use your new language for your everyday needs, for example in shops and restaurants, in dealing with paperwork, and for socialising, then you'll pick up language skills much more quickly than you would from casual use.

As with other languages, if you want to learn English, then your pronunciation and sentence structure will be greatly improved through regular interactions with native speakers. For this reason, moving to a country whose native language is English in order to study can be greatly beneficial. Today we're discussing the different countries where you could consider studying English, and the advantages of each.

An important issue to remember is that English varies considerably in pronunciation, grammar, spelling, and vocabulary between different countries. It's not for nothing that the US and UK are known as "two countries separated by a common language"! However, the good news is that English speakers of any background can generally understand each other, despite the differences in their language use. Wherever you choose to study English, it's likely that you'll have no problems in communicating with other English speakers from around the world. So how do you choose where to study?
