You might have noticed that we talk about Scottish whisky, but American whiskey â€“ the contrast in spelling is just one of the differences between these two whisky styles. In Scotch whisky, the basic ingredient is malted barley, which is mashed with warm water, and may or may not have other grains added to it later in the process. But in American whiskey, the process begins with a mixture of grains, which are heated to a higher temperature and cooked, then sent straight into the still instead of being filtered off. Also, American distilleries typically use pot stills, which are short and fat with a round base, whereas Scotch distilleries use a range of still styles and shapes which produce a wider variety of whisky characters and flavours.
