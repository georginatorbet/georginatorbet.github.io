A conference presentation by Wang et al. has recently garnered a lot of media attention, suggesting that playing violent video games can alter brain function and could lead to violent behavior. Given the increasing amount of time that young people in particular are spending using computers and playing games, it is important for scientists to consider how this could be affecting social interactions. Is controlling a game character who shots other people detrimental to one’s empathy? Could it encourage such behaviors away from the computer and in the real world? What are people learning from games, and are these lessons conducive to a stable society? A recent “Perspectives” piece in Nature Review. Neuroscience (Bavelier et al., 2011) saw a number of researchers expressing concern over the effects of video games and calling for further study.

Unfortunately, despite (or perhaps because of) the importance of this topic, the quality of scientific research in 
this area is often poor. This latest study by Wang et al. has not been published in a journal but was, rather, presented at a conference, so full data is not available for comment or analysis. It is the author’s opinion that the media reporting of non-peer-reviewed studies without full data available is a shockingly irresponsible practice about which all researchers should be concerned.

What, then, were the presented findings? Two groups of young men who did not regularly play computer games were 
recruited, and in one week one group played 10 hours of a violent video game. Both groups were then given a  functional MRI (fMRI) scan, and after a further week in which neither group played computer games, both groups were scanned again. The gaming group showed less activation in the left inferior frontal lobe and the anterior cingulate cortex in comparison to their baseline scans. This difference in activation was diminished after the week of not playing.

The glaring issue here is the inadequacy of the control group. If the desire was to examine the effect of violent 
games in particular, then the control group ought to have played nonviolent games. Without this, any differences 
found could be due to exposure to screens, using a computer in any way, or even just sitting in front of a screen. It is impossible to know if the effects found were related to the games played. Furthermore, no information was given on how games were classified as “violent.” Do violent games differ in their effects from violent movies? Is there a difference between violence against human beings rather than inanimate objects? Does it make a difference if violence is shown to have consequences and a human cost? These are interesting and important questions regarding violent games that this study completely failed to address.

Also notable is that differences in brain activation were lessened after a week of not playing games. If there were 
a genuine effect on the brain, it was transient and quickly receded when the activity ceased. And yet, astonishingly, Dr. Wang, one of the authors claimed that “These findings indicate that violent video game play has a long-term effect on brain functioning.” In fact, the findings suggest the exact opposite of this.

Whatever one’s personal feelings regarding the increasing presence of technology in our lives, we must maintain 
scientific objectivity when assessing its effect on our behavior. It is precisely because computers have become such an important part of our society that we must investigate their effects with full scientific vigor and without prejudice. Providing inaccurate quotes that distort the findings of unpublished research to fit an established media narrative cannot be accepted as good scientific practice.
