<h3>Proofreading services</h3>
<p>I offer proofreading of English texts, for both commercial and academic purposes. Let me help your report, paper or thesis shine! 

I correct spelling, grammar, and English phrasing, and in addition I can edit academic texts. </p>

<p>I am a native English speaker (born and educated in Britain), and have been proofreading for private businesses for several months now. I have extensive experience of written work in both science and philosophy, having a BA in Philosophy and an MSc in Neuroscience in addition to my PhD in psychology. I can therefore confidently proofread and edit a broad range of topics, specialising in social and natural sciences.</p>
