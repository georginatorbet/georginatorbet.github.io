<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p>My principle research interests are unusual experiences of self and agency in the schizophrenic spectrum. My research takes an interdisciplinary approach involving methods from both experimental psychology (using eye tracking to implicitly measure disruptions of agency) and from phenomenological psychiatry (using interviews to assess disorders of self).</p>
