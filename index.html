<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I am an interdisciplinary researcher with an enthusiasm for diverse approaches and bridging the gap between philosophy and science. I am passionate about sharing knowledge and methodologies between academic disciplines through teaching, and about public engagement to share scientific understanding and discoveries.</p>

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p>My principle research interests are unusual experiences of self and agency in the schizophrenic spectrum. My current research takes an interdisciplinary approach involving methods from both experimental psychology (using eye tracking to implicitly measure disruptions of agency) and from phenomenological psychiatry (using interviews to assess disorders of self).</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I began my academic career with an undergraduate degree in Philosophy form the University of Southampton, followed by an MSc in the Philosophy of Mental Disorder from King's College London, and an MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience from University College London and Birkbeck. During this time I also worked in administration for the doctorate in clinical psychology at the Institute of Psychiatry, London. I moved to Berlin in 2011 to undertake a PhD at the Institute for Psychology of the Humboldt University of Berlin.</p>

<h3>Current Work</h3>
<p>I recently submitted my PhD thesis on disruptions of self and agency in the schizophrenic spectrum as part of the <a href="http://www.mind-and-brain.de/home/" target="_blank">Berlin School of Mind and Brain</a>, where I currently hold a postdoctoral scholarship.</p>
